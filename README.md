# sobosite
A template (stub) site to start work with.  Angular frontend, django backend.

On May 11, 2025, the frontend part for Sobosite has been moved to another repository:
https://github.com/krzysobo/sobosite_frontend

The reason for this is that I am now "spreading" Sobosite functionality across multiple languages, 
including PHP and Kotlin, and frameworks, so it makes sense for all of them to be able to use the same front-end.
